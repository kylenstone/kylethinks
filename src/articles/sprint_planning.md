Correct order for sprint planning exercise



A word on sprint goals and "fail fast."  Experimenting with aggressive learnings about how to solve an ill-understood problem *requires* a high failure rate at the beginning.  Those failures should be weaned out of the pipeline by the time you get to more executional sprints geared toward feature releases.  "Failure creates the empirical data required to make informed assumptions about what should and can be done next." [Roman Pichler, Effective Sprint Goals](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/effective-sprint-goals/)
