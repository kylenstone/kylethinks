      </div>      <p>Half a century ago, Peter Drucker summarized a fundamental shift in the world of work with a typically concise epigram: workers no longer need strong hands, they need effective minds [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy">1</a>].  Four decades later, the same Drucker elaborated that in traditional workforces, workers served the system; but in a knowledge workforce, <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/02/theyre-not-employees-theyre-people">the system must serve the worker</a>.</p>
<p>What does it mean for an organization to embrace the notion that it serves its workers?  What do &#39;servants&#39; actually do within an organization, and what do they seek to accomplish?  </p>
<p>In this article I advance my own definition of servant leadership, and identify its core components.  Servant leadership, of course, has been written up thousands of times in hundreds of ways.  Yet most explanations stop short of practical guidance for embodying the idea in a way that can be put to use in day-to-day workplace scenarios.  My explication is most applicable to small to medium-sized technology companies, but should carry weight in other environments as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-servant-leadership-">What is servant leadership?</h2>
<p>Servant leadership is a mindset that combines qualities of <a href="../servant_leader_qualities">selflessness, patience and empathy</a> with a management philosophy designed to motivate employees and foster growth.  Managers who embrace the creative potential of servant leadership drive cohesion and positive thinking through their teams and shape their organizations to become more resilient and competitive.</p>
<h2 id="inspire-trust">Inspire trust</h2>
<p>Assigning work is a fundamental part of effective management.  The most straightforward way to inspire trust is through artful and deliberate assignment of work.  Before directing employees, the servant leader evaluates the needs of their organization, prioritizes unmet needs, and identifies areas where the diligence she will foster among her team will make maximum impact.  Weighing each employees strengths and weaknesses, she assigns work to employees based on fit according to specific and observable criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will empowering this employee to meet this need maximize their growth?</li>
<li>Does the need align with the skills, interests, and development path of the employee?</li>
</ol>
<p>The servant leader challenges her team to internalize the needs of the organization.  &quot;Your role as servant is to facilitate the relationship between each employee and the organization,&quot; writes Carol A. Walker, president of leadership consultancy <a href="http://www.preparedtolead.com/">Prepared to Lead</a> writes in <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/new-managers-need-a-philosophy-about-how-theyll-lead">Harvard Business Review</a>.  &quot;Ask yourself, &#39;<em>What will it take for this employee to be successful in this relationship?</em>&#39;  And, &#39;<em>What does the organization need to provide in order to hold up its end of the bargain?</em>&#39;  When these questions drive your thinking, you advance both parties&#39; interests.&quot;</p>
<p>How do you know once you&#39;ve gained an employee&#39;s trust?  If information flows to you without your asking for it, or employees run problems or concerns across your desk, you&#39;re on the right track.  Even employees who complain brashly may be a good thing.  In a fast-changing workplace such as a tech startup, the quieting of complaints could be a signal an employee has burned out or plans to leave the company.</p>
<p>Shy employees can&#39;t be expected to march up and declare, &quot;I&#39;d like to work on this initiative.&quot;  The Servant leader encourages self direction by asking, &quot;What are the contributions this organization and I, your manager, should expect from you?  If the answer is qualitative or narrowly scoped (&quot;I never leave QA test plans unfinished  on Fridays&quot;), the servant leader probes the employees for the value they see in their existing way of doing things, then matches their skills with appropriate initiatives.  The servant leader follows up in 1-on-1&#39;s to hear what&#39;s working and adjusts if things aren&#39;t working well.  Carol A. Walker comments, &quot;An employee who believes her boss understands her strengths, values her input, and encourages her growth is likely to stick around for the long term.&quot; <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/new-managers-need-a-philosophy-about-how-theyll-lead?referral=03758&amp;cm_vc=rr_item_page.top_right">HBR</a></p>
<h2 id="build-accountability-and-integrity">Build accountability and integrity</h2>
<p>Servant leaders expect the best from their teams, a trait they demonstrate in a unique way: they <em>assume</em> those around them have good reasons for acting how they do, even when the specific reasons are not known.  If an employee&#39;s motives or performance come under attack, for example in an emergency triage meeting, the servant leaders backs up their employee by taking responsibility for the issue and instilling confidence that a resolution will follow immediately.  Avoided excuses or blame-casting, the servant leader follows up with the employee in a calm and collected manner, creating an environment conducive to full divulgement of the issue at hand.  The servant leader explains why the issue is important to them personally; asks earnest questions and listens with empathy; removes judgment or negative appraisal from the dialogue, recognizing where the employee currently stands on the maturity or experience curve; and works alongside the employee to outline a solution that helps them move forward.  A budding sense of accountability helps the servant leader&#39;s team feel personally invested in the success of the company.</p>
<h2 id="motivate-employees">Motivate Employees</h2>
<p>Equipped with empoyees who value accountability and integrity is a major milestone for the servant leader, but an early milestone.  The work does not stop there.  Trust must be sustained in the long term for the servant leader to win what most workplace managers really want: influence and extraordinary results.</p>
<p>The servant leader has a distinct advantage over traditional managers for the simple reason that <em>its not about you.</em>  &quot;It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first,” wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Greenleaf">Robert K Greenleaf</a>, credited as the originator of modern servant leadership. “Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead.  That person is sharply different from one who is leader first... The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant first to make sure that other people&#39;s highest priority needs are being served.&quot;  Removing ego from the equation frees up head space to evaluate objectively and think creatively.  Attracted to the qualities of focus and clear-mindedness personified by the servant leader, employees flock for help solving their hardest problems, ones that couldn&#39;t have possibly been anticipated when work was assigned.  The problems running across her desk keep the servant leader&#39;s her ear to the ground for changes taking hold across the organization, enabling her to locate opportunities to add new domains of expertise  her team and expose them to new experiences.</p>
<p>The servant leader shows how employees&#39; own ambitions and motivations belong to the bigger picture of a successful organization.  Encouraging teammates to form independent aspirations for how their talents help the organization flourish, the servant leader establishes an agenda for growth inclusive to the objectives pursued by leaders elsewhere in the organization.  Supporting the goals of other teams lets the team&#39;s talents be broadly known and earns the servant leader reputation as someone who values the betterment of the organization over personal advancement.</p>
<p>Establishing a growth agenda requires a thorough understanding of organizational constraints and the audacity to question or remove the most oppressive ones. Isolating the problems that impede business and hold people back, the servant leader works to eliminate waste and free up resources.  She knocks down artificial walls and insists upon an empirical mindset that prioritizes cross-functional collaboration and experimentation.  The servant leader envisions teams as engines where each contributor acts like a cylinder in the engine block.  To succeed, all must fire all at once.  The servant leader knows that only by pulling people together will she achieve something great.  </p>
<p>Armed with a leader who aspires to greatness, employees are themselves more proactive and productive.  They too seek opportunities to inspire those around them.</p>

<h2 id="use-momentum-to-empower-more-servant-leaders">Use momentum to empower more servant leaders</h2>
<p>A project manager comes to the servant leader with a problem: three frontend developers on his team spent the past week spinning wheels after senior developers rejected their code commits.  The PM spoke with the senior developers who felt the team&#39;s work was rushed, pointing him to numerous instances where the project violated conventions maintained by the development organization.  When the PM spoke to his team about the pushback they threw up their hands and accused the senior developers of <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">yak shaving</a> without understanding the product or its requirements.  The senior developers feel speed has been traded against quality.  The PM&#39;s team is exasperated from incorporating hundreds of code changes requested by the senior developers and feel that the goalposts keep moving.  The servant leader listens to the PM and asks, &quot;How can I help solve the problem?&quot;  The PM considers asking the servant leader to step in directly, but would rather solve the problem himself.  The PM relates his real concern, the growing animosity he&#39;s seen from both sides and the resulting loss of morale.  He worries that if the developer teams don&#39;t learn to support one another the same issue will continue to surface again and again.  &quot;What can you do to get everyone on the same page?  I&#39;ll support your efforts however I can,&quot; says the servant leader.<br>The PM proposes a summit bringing all frontend developers across the company to the San Francisco office to discuss conventions, pair program, and hash out a shared identity for their function.  &quot;What would your role be?&quot; Asks the servant leader.  The PM becomes highly animated and volunteers to organize a big agenda, administer every meeting, and meet people at the airport to make them feel more welcome.  The servant leader considers momentarily and replies, &quot;You don&#39;t need to convince me you&#39;ll work hard at this.  You&#39;re a highly capable leader.  But remember the goal you stated a moment ago: you want frontend developers to support one another.  Doesn&#39;t that mean you need to take more of a backseat role?&quot;  The servant leader helps the PM understand that running the whole show will counteract his true goal to empower frontend developers to think more like a team and build processes to resolve issues impeding their work.</p>
<p>The PM moves forward with the summit.  Straight away he solicits help from two highly motivated developers considered domain experts.  He conveys the expectation that they will contribute leadership to the event; they respond positively, so he asks them to summarize what they intend to do by Friday.  He communicates his appreciation and offers to support them any way he can.  One of the developers opts to organize pair programming sessions; the other offers to run two sessions on incorporating a powerful new framework into the codebase.  The develop running pair programming asks for a hand booking the pairing machines in advance.  The PM confirms it&#39;s been done later that day.</p>
<p>Even the insinuation that somebody <em>could</em> represent themselves as a leader can go a long way.  In the case of the developer their job is first and foremost to build applications; writing and reviewing code take precedence over other activities.  But once clued into a problem set and offered support from a project manager who is probably already viewed as an effective leader, members of an organization across all departments and levels of seniority reveal themselves as highly effective problem solvers.  Exposing others to the challenges of leadership work promotes merit-based leadership and deepens the organization&#39;s appreciation and need for effective service leadershiop.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>&quot;People who become known for inclusiveness and smart decisions tend to develop influence far more consistently than those who believe they have all the answers.&quot; ~ Carol A. Walker</em></p>
<p>Greatness results from seeing the potential in people and spending time developing it.  Find people in your organization who inspire you.  Know them and be known by them.  Listen to them empathically, treat them inclusively, and incorporate their goals in your own agenda for growth.</p>
